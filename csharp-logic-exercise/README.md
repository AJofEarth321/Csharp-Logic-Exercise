Logic  Exercise
This exercise contains basic logic problems for you to solve.
To complete the exercise, provide a working implementation for each method.

Setup

Open the project in your editor
Provide solutions to each of the methods in the CSharpLogic class, following the instructions in the comments.


Testing Your Solutions
A number of unit tests have been written to test the implementation of each method.
To test your solutions:

Open the CSharpLogicTests class and right click on the test of the method you are trying to test. For example, the test named 'GetGradeReturnsA' is testing the method getGrade with a value which should return 'A'.
A dialog should appear and indicate whether the test passed or failed.
To run all of the tests, you can right click on the LogicExerciseTest class and click Run LogicExerciseTest.
